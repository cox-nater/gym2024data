## Identify the group of 5 athletes (5 Men and 5 Women) who will enable the team USA olympic Menâ€™s and Women's artistic gymnastics teams to maximize medal winnings at 2024 Paris Olympics.

## Upload Data

```{r cars}
data_2022_2024 <- vroom('cleandata/data_2022_2023.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
